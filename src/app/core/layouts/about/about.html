      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Federico, a software developer based in Italy.
        <br>
        I started coding in the late ’80s, when I was around five years old only: now that I have been diagnosed with high-intelligence <abbr title="Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, it makes sense.
        <br>
        
        <br>
        Nice to meet you.
