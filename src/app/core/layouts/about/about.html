      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Federico, a software developer based in Italy.
        <br><br>
        I started coding in the late 1980s, when I was around five years old: now that I’ve been diagnosed with high-intelligence <abbr title="Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr>, it makes sense.
        <br><br>
        I haven’t always been a programmer. I’ve been a researcher, a web editor, and I studied classical literature in high school. I graduated with a degree in communication sciences and completed a master’s degree in sociology.
        <br><br>
        Nice to meet you.
